A simple macro to get the name of the current crate.
like `line!`, `file!`...

```toml
crate-_-name = "0.1"
```
```
let name = crate___name::crate_name!();
```


Why is the name of this crate so...emm.. peculiar?
We all know that some crates with normal names in crates.io are empty. I can't think of what this library can be called, so...
